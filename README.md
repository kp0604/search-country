Project made on these requirements - 
https://gist.github.com/shhdharmen/35663b9ded76405102e110b5dff1722c

I have completed all features asked and used only 1 library that is axios.


Getting Started 

git clone https://github.com/kp0604/search-country.git
cd /
npm install

Start Development Server 

npm run dev

server will run on -
http://localhost:5173/



Note - in bonus section for limiting api calls on keystrokes a mechanism is asked , i could have applied debouncing but the calls are already limited as the searching call is done only when user uses keyboard shortcut which was asked as functionality instruction so debouncing is not used in this case.
